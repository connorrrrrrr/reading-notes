# Creating a Website

* When creating a site, you need to design it for the targeted audience. It is very important to understand who your targeted audience is.
* What is the age range of the targeted audience?
* What gender will your site appeal more to?
* Which country do your visitors live in?

It is best to identify why others want to visit your site. Discover the underlying **motivations** for why visitors come to the site.


* Are they looking for general entertainment?
* If there is a specific goal, is it a personal or professional one?
* Do they see spending time on your website as essential or a luxury?
* Create a list of potential reasons why people may visit.

All of this information can help you guide your site designs and help you find what information your visitors need. You need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively. By ensuring that you provide the information that your visitors are looking for, they will consider your site more relevant to them. Think about what you're offering that seprates you from similar sites. Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others.

Questions to help you decide how often to update your website content:
**Goods/Services**

1. How often do the same people return to purchase from you?
2. How often is your stock updated or your service changed?

**Information**

1. How often is the subject updated?
2. What percentage of your visitors would return for regular updates on the subject, compared with those who will just need the information once?

Once you have figured out what needs to appear on the site, you will need to figure out how you will organize it. A **site map** is a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. A **wireframe** is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. You can sketch wireframes on paper or use a graphics application on your computer.

### Getting your message across using design

The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to **communicate**. Organizing and prioritizing information helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.

**Site Navigation** not only helps people find _where they want to go_, but also helps them _understand what your site is about_. A good navigation is concise, clear, selective, interactive, consistent, and provides context.

## HTML

HTML describes the structure of web pages and uses elements to do this. Each element has an opening and closing tag. Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a **name** and a **value**, _seperated by an equals sign_.

* Body
    - everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser.
* Head
    - Before the body you will often see a head, this contains information about the page.
* Title
    - The contents of the title are shown in the top of the browser, above the URL bar.
* Headers and Footers
    - the main header or footer that appears at the bottom or top of every page on the site.
* Navigation
    - the nav element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
* Article
    - The article element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
* Aside
    - The aside element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an article element or not. When the aside element is used inside an article element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. When the aside element is used outside, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.
* Section
    - The section element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
* Hgroup
    - The purpose of the hgroup element is to group together a set of one or more h1 through h6 elements so that they are treated as one single heading.
* Figure
    - Can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article. The figure element should also contain a figcaption element which provides a text description for the content of the figure element.
* Meta
    - the meta element lives inside the head element and contains information about that web page.
* iframe
    - an iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page and in that window you can see another page. Needs width, height, and src.
