# Intro to CSS

Imagine there is a block around every HTML element. CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.

**Examples**

* Boxes
* Text
* Specifics

## Common Elements

* the **link** element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page, does not need a closing tag. Lives inside (head) element.
* **href** specifies the path to the CSS file. Often placed in a folder called "css" or "styles".
* the **type** attribute specifies the type of document being linked to.
* **rel** specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to.
