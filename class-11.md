## Images

- by default, images are inline elements
- in order to center an image, it should be turned into a block-level element using the `dislplay` property with a value of _block_. Then you can use the `text-align` property with a value of center. You can also use the `margin` property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.
- you can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.
- to reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.

## Search Engine Optimization

- SEO is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.
- ensure that any images have appropriate text in the value of their `alt` attribute.
- Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.
- To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.
- FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.
