## Top 3 Significant Readings

1. The 4 things that makes a computer a computer are: the ability to take input, store it somehwere, proccess it, then output it somewhere else. The earliest computers were made out of wood and metal and today's computers still have the 4 basic functions that the early ones had.
2. Numbers can be stored as on or off (1 or 0)electrical signals. Sound can be broken down in into a series of numbers using graphs to represent frequencies. Every input and output of information is represented by simply **on** or **off**.
3. One command from a modern programming language can send hundreds or even thousands of simpler binary commands to the CPU.
