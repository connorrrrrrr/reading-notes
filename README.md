### Growth Mindset
How to stay in a growth mindset.
* ~~Step outside of comfort zone.~~
* Continue to attempt difficult tasks.
* Stay **_persistant_** at the result of failure.

To maintain a growth mindset is to _always_ keep an **open mind**. It is very important to take all things into consideration during any process you go through. Whether you succeed or fail, it is important to always reflect on what you learned depending on your outcome.
