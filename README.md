### About Me
My name is Connor Curtis. I am 22 years old and originally from Arkansas. My main hobby is playing video games. My love for video games eventually taught me about what coding was and helped me develop the fascination I have for it. :video_game:

### Growth Mindset
How to stay in a growth mindset.
- [x] Step outside of comfort zone.
- [ ] Continue to attempt difficult tasks.
- [ ] Stay **_persistant_** at the result of failure.

To maintain a growth mindset is to _always_ keep an **open mind**. It is very important to take all things into consideration during any process you go through. ***Whether you succeed or fail***, it is important to always _reflect_ on what you've learned depending on your outcome.
