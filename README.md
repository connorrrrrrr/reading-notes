### About Me
My name is Connor Curtis. I am 22 years old and from Arkansas. My main hobby is playing video games. My love for video games eventually taught me about what coding was and helped me develop the fascination I have for it.

### Growth Mindset
How to stay in a growth mindset.
- [x] Stepping outside of comfort zone.
- [ ] Continuing to attempt difficult tasks.
- [ ] Staying **_persistant_** at the result of failure.

To maintain a growth mindset is to _always_ keep an **open mind**. It is very important to take all things into consideration during any process you go through. ***Whether you succeed or fail***, it is important to always _reflect_ on what you've learned depending on your outcome.
