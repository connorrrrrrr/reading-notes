# Javascript

If html is the content layer and css is the presentation layer, javascript would be the behavior layer. This is how we add interactivity to our webpages. A javascript file is just a text file but it has .js file extension. It is best to keep javascript code in its own javascript file. The HTML **script** element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the javascript file. Javascript is case sensitive.

- a script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one by one. Each individual instruction or step is called a **statement**.
- a **semicolon** tells the javascript interpreter that a step is over.
- you should write comments to explain what your code does.
- variables are used to "remember" values.

1. var is an example of what programmers call a keyword. The javascript interpreter knows that this keyword is used to create a variable.
2. in order to use the variable, you must give it a name. If a variable name is more than one word, it is usually written in camelCase. The first word is all lowercase and any subsequent words have their first letter capitalized.
3. the equals sign is an **assignment operator**. It says that you are going to assign a value to the variable. Until you have assigned a value to a variable, programmers say the value is undefined.

## Data Types

1. the **numeric data type** handles numbers.
2. the **string data type** consists of letters and other characters.
3. the **boolean data type** can have one of two values, true or false.

Six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name:
1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or an underscore. Cannot start with number.
2. The name can only contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or an underscore.
3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable.
4. All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice.
5. Use a name taht describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word **after** the first word. For example: firstName rather than firstname.
