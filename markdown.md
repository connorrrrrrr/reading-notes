# Markdown

- A way to style text on the web
- Similar to regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters like # or *
- Can be used in most places around GitHub

## What is it used for?

1. Formatting words as **bold** or _italic_.
2. Adding images
3. Creating lists

# This is an H1
## This is an H2
### This is an H3
#### This is an H4

Put an underscore _before and after_ selected text to italicize it.

Put two asterisks **before and after** selected text to bold it.

_You can **combine** bold and italicized text as well._ 

You can create tables by dividing words with hyphens and seperating each colomn with pipes (|).
