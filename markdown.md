# Markdown

- A way to style text on the web
- Similar to regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters like # or *
- Can be used in most places around GitHub

You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are a few things done with markdown.

## What is it used for?

1. Formatting words as **bold** or _italic_.
2. Adding images
3. Creating lists

# This is an H1
## This is an H2
### This is an H3
#### This is an H4

Put an underscore _before and after_ selected text to italicize it.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line

Put two asterisks **before and after** selected text to bold it.

_You can **combine** bold and italicized text as well._ 

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.

You can create tables by dividing words with hyphens and seperating each colomn with pipes (|).
