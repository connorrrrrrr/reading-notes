# What is a text editor?

A text editor is a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. It is one of the most important tools web developers use. 

## Choosing a text editor

Some of the most important features of a text editor are:
* Code completion
* Syntax highlighting
* Nice variety of themes
* The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions
Usually, the text editors that come on your computer don't have many features.
