# What is a text editor?

A text editor is a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. It is one of the most important tools web developers use. 

## Choosing a text editor

Some of the most important features of a text editor are:
* Code completion
* Syntax highlighting
* Nice variety of themes
* The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions

Usually, the text editors that come on your computer don't have many features.

1. Notepad ++ is a free text editor for Windows Computers only
2. BB Edit is a paid text editor for Mac only.
3. Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by Microsoft. It has all the features you would need in a text editor. It is also available across all platforms.
4. Atom is a free text editor made by the people at GitHub and it is available across all platforms.
5. Brackets is a free text editor made by Adobe that is available across all platforms. Only supports HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
6. Sublime Text 3 is a premium software that can be fully purchased for $70. Also has a free version.

## Text Editors Vs. IDEs

A text editor is a software that edits texts and manages files.

An IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment) is a text editor, file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one.

It is important to try out many text editors to see which one fits your personal needs the best. There are many factors that go into play when deciding which text editor is right for you. Such as: the price, amount of features, and the availability on your platform.

# Terminal Usage

A command line, or **terminal**, is a text based interface to the system. You enter commands with the keyboard and recieve feedback as text. Opening a terminal can be different for each OS. Within a terminal is a **shell**. It is a part of the OS that defines how the terminal will behave and look after running commands for you. There are a variety of shells available but the most common is called "Bash". To see what shell you're using you may use a command called "echo" to display a system variable stating your current shell.

## Navigation

The command, "pwd" tells you what your current working directory is. This command is useful for reminding yourself where you presently are. The command, "ls" tells you what is in the current directory. "~" is a shortcut for your home directory. "." is a reference to your current directory. ".." is a reference to the parent directory (this can be used several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy. The command, "cd" lets you change directories. If you use "cd" by itself it will take you to your home directory. A **relative path** is a directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system. An **absolute path** is a directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

### Files

Everything is a file. Common file extensions include:
* file.exe - an executable file, or program
* file.txt - plain text file
* file.png, .gif, .jpg - an image

Linux is **CASE SENSITIVE**. The command, "ls -a" lists the contents of a directory, including hidden files. Linux is an extensionless sytem meaning files can have any extesnion they like or none at all.
