# What is a text editor?

A text editor is a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. It is one of the most important tools web developers use. 

## Choosing a text editor

Some of the most important features of a text editor are:
* Code completion
* Syntax highlighting
* Nice variety of themes
* The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions

Usually, the text editors that come on your computer don't have many features.

1. Notepad ++ is a free text editor for Windows Computers only
2. BB Edit is a paid text editor for Mac only.
3. Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by Microsoft. It has all the features you would need in a text editor. It is also available across all platforms.
4. Atom is a free text editor made by the people at GitHub and it is available across all platforms.
5. Brackets is a free text editor made by Adobe that is available across all platforms. Only supports HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Text Editors Vs. IDEs
